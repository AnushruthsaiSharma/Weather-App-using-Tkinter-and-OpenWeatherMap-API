# Weather-App-using-Tkinter-and-OpenWeatherMap-API
This project is a weather forecasting application built with Tkinter. It fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API based on the city entered by the user. The app uses libraries like geopy, timezonefinder, and pytz to display local time and weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed.
